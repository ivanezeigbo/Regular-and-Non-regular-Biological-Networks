# Regular-and-Non-regular-Biological-Networks
Computer Simulation and Modeling: Research on evolution in regular networks as opposed to non-regular networks<br>

# File Structure

## Regular Networks
garcia_punish = Regular network with Punishers <br>
garcia_testing = Regular network without Punishers <br>

## Non-regular Networks
coop_with_pun = Non-regular network with Punishers <br>
coop_without_pun = Non-regular network without Punishers <br>


# Additional Functionalities
Comment the plotter() function after the line "if Same == True #case for everyone having the same strategy" (you can Ctrl + F or Cmd + F this as they may appear at different lines of code for the four models) and the lines of code right under 'label = {}' up until 'plt.show()' in the Graph() function in order to avoid watching the generational evolution in the biological network. <br>

To view graph, first install networkx.<br>

> pip install networkx
